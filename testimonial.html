    <title>TESTIMONIAL</title>

<body>
I am currently a Graduate Student Instructor for the The Program on Intergroup relations, and I co-teach the Facilitation Practicum Course. As part of this class, our students write testimonials about a salient social identity. These testminomals can take many forms, and below is the one I shared with my class. </br></br>

flashback seven years</br>
to a kid still scared</br>
of the world around them</br>
a girl, then, who couldn’t stand the color of her skin</br>
who wished she looked more like</br>
the blonde and blue-eyed barbie dolls</br>
she played with when she was young</br>
</br>
i remember</br>
playground taunts that followed</br>
long after we left the swingsets behind</br>
but “god, it was just a joke” and “don’t be so sensitive”</br>
“seriously, you need to chill”</br>
</br>
a friend once claimed she could do a dead-on impression of my dad</br>
she opened her mouth and</br>
mangled words that didn’t sound like anything I’d ever heard</br>
fell from her lips and i saw</br>
every stereotype, every assumption, every sly comment or joke</br>
staring me in the face</br>

with shame in the space where my heart should have been</br>
and frustration crackling along my skin like static</br>
i took a breath and said,</br>
“my dad sounds nothing like that”</br>
</br>
freeze frame: several slightly horrified faces</br>
staring at me, my audacity at contradicting her:</br>
glances back and forth between my friends</br>
unsure how to handle the absence of my timidity</br>
“dude, i’m just messing around. why’d you have to make it weird?”</br>
</br>
a friend once claimed she could do a dead-on impression of my dad</br>
she opened her mouth and</br>
what died was any sense of belonging I had</br>
</br>
comfort came though, in the form of another friend, saying</br>
“hey, it’s alright. sticks and stones and all that, y’know?”</br>
i do know</br>
“sticks and stones will break my bones but words - “</br>
words will leave bruises that nobody can see</br>
leave me</br>
swallowing spoonfuls of self-hatred</br>
and internalized -isms</br>
brown girl scrubbing skin with bleach</br>
cutting off parts of myself, contorting to fit</br>
boxes that were only ever meant to diminish me</br>
</br>
years later,</br>
when i learned to reconcile</br>
my brown, my queer, my brain wired weird</br>
*I* made a joke</br>
it went like this:</br>
something something white people</br>
something something you don’t get</br>
to make me feel bad about myself anymore</br>
</br>
and a former friend responded:</br>
“wow, I don’t remember you having</br>
so much hate in your heart”</br>
</br>
listen: i’m sorry</br>
a sense of pride</br>
and celebration of who i am</br>
looks to you like hate</br>
(plus, that seems like a you problem)</br>
</br>
it’s funny though (actually it’s not)</br>
because even with that pride</br>
i still thought i wasn’t the “right kind of brown”</br>
too wild, beyond binaries, thinking of</br>
impossible futures</br>
</br>
i used to joke that</br>
the greatest tragedy of my life as a brown girl</br>
was that i had no sense of rhythm and</br>
in truth, i still struggle</br>
with the cultural expectations</br>
placed on me</br>
to be “the good kind of brown”</br>
even from the people whose skin mirrors mine</br>
</br>
i can be proud of my race, my ethnicity, my culture</br>
but i realized it doesn’t do me any good</br>
if i can’t tell myself *why* and what does that actually mean</br>
in the context of me?</br>
</br>
i don’t know that my seventeen year old self</br>
would recognize me at twenty-five</br>
i think she’d be a little freaked out, actually</br>
</br>
but i know now</br>
that while I can’t crawl out of the color of my skin</br>
anymore than i can ask if my chromosomes can maybe</br>
combine differently, this time?</br>
</br>
there’s no one way to be</br>
brown, south asian, malayali, or me</br>
that as time ticks on</br>
i am allowed to grow, to shift</br>
there’s no mold i need to fit</br>
</br>
show me a sense of self that is unchanging</br>
and i will show you a ghost</br>
</br>
the truth: every iteration of myself is real</br>
</br>
so, slowly but surely</br>
i have learned</br>
how to settle in my skin</br>
to see myself</br>
in full color</br>
and know that I am enough.</br>
